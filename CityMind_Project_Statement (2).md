# 1. Project Overview

This project presents you with a real-world problem. A mid-sized city is
under pressure. It is growing fast, its infrastructure is aging,
emergencies are becoming harder to manage, and city planners are
struggling to keep up. Your task is to design and build an intelligent
system called CityMind that helps city authorities make smarter, faster,
and better-informed decisions.

What makes this project different from a typical assignment is that you
are not being told how to solve the problem. You are given the problem,
and your group must figure out the solution. You will decide which
algorithms to use, how to combine them, and how to justify those
choices. The quality of your thinking matters as much as the quality of
your code.

The city is modeled as a grid-based graph where locations are nodes and
roads are edges. Every location has properties such as type, population
density, accessibility, and risk level. Your system will work on this
shared city graph and must address five operational challenges described
in Section 3.

| Before writing a single line of code, your group must spend time      |
| understanding the problem and designing your solution. Your first     |
| graded deliverable is a design document, not code. This means you     |
| must think, discuss, and plan first. The implementation phase comes   |
| after your group has agreed on an approach and had it reviewed.       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

# 2. The City Model

The city is represented as a graph. You are free to choose the size and
density of this graph, but it must be large enough to make the problems
meaningful. Each node in the graph represents a location and stores the
following information:

-   Location type: Residential, Hospital, School, Industrial, Power
    Plant, or Ambulance Depot

-   Population density: a numeric value indicating how many people live
    or work there

-   Risk index: a value that can be updated dynamically during
    simulation

-   Accessibility flag: indicates whether the location is currently
    reachable

Edges between nodes represent roads. Each road has a travel cost.
Standard roads have a cost of 1.0. Roads through residential zones cost
0.8. A road that has been blocked (due to flooding, an accident, or any
environmental event) becomes impassable and must be treated as such by
every part of your system immediately.

This shared graph is the single source of truth for your entire system.
No module is allowed to maintain its own separate copy of the city. If a
road floods, every component of your system must know about it.

# 3. The Five Challenges

Your system must address the following five challenges. For each one,
you are given the problem description and the constraints. Your group
must determine the most appropriate approach from the AI and search
techniques you have covered this semester. In your design document, you
must justify why you chose a particular technique and why it is better
suited to this problem than the alternatives.

## Challenge 1: City Layout Planning

The city starts as an empty grid. Your system needs to place different
types of locations (hospitals, schools, industrial zones, residential
areas, power plants, ambulance depots) on this grid in a way that
respects urban planning rules.

The rules your layout must satisfy are:

-   Industrial zones cannot be placed next to schools or hospitals

-   Every residential area must be within three road hops of at least
    one hospital

-   Power plants must be placed within 2 road hops of at least one
    Industrial zone, since they exist to supply power to industrial
    areas.

-   The configuration must be checked for mathematical validity; if no
    valid layout is possible given the grid size and rules, your system
    must identify which specific rule is causing the conflict and
    propose minimum conflict solution.

*Think about the nature of this problem. What kind of problem is it?
What approaches have you studied that deal with assigning values under
constraints?*

## Challenge 2: Road Network Optimization

Once the city layout is established, your system must determine which
roads should be built. The goal is to connect all locations using the
minimum total road cost. However, there is a critical safety
requirement: there must always be at least two completely independent
routes between the Primary Hospital and the Ambulance Depot. If any
single road fails, an alternative path must remain available.

*Think about what kind of optimization problem this is. What is the
search space? How large is it? What approach allows you to find a
globally optimal or near-optimal solution under this kind of
constraint?*

## Challenge 3: Ambulance Placement

The city has three ambulances. These ambulances need to be positioned at
locations on the grid such that no citizen is unreasonably far from
help. The objective is to minimize the worst-case response time, meaning
the position of the ambulance that is furthest from any citizen should
be as close as possible.

*The number of possible placements grows quickly with grid size. Think
about the scale of this search space. What strategies have you studied
that can find good solutions efficiently without necessarily examining
every possibility? Consider the role of randomness and evolution in
search.*

## Challenge 4: Emergency Routing Under Changing Conditions

A medical team needs to travel through the city to reach a series of
trapped civilians in sequence. The environment is not static: roads may
flood or become blocked while the team is already on its way. The moment
a road becomes impassable, the team must immediately recalculate the
best available route to continue its mission.

The constraints are:

-   The team must reach all civilians, not just the nearest one

-   Route recalculation must happen in real time whenever the
    environment changes

-   The system must guarantee that it always finds the shortest
    currently available path, not just any path

*What kind of search is appropriate here? What property must your
heuristic satisfy if you want a guarantee of finding the shortest path?
How does your algorithm adapt when the graph changes mid-journey?*

## Challenge 5: Crime Risk Prediction and Integration

The city has 10 police officers to deploy. To allocate them
intelligently, the system must analyze neighborhood data and predict
where crime is most likely to occur.

The pipeline for this challenge is as follows:

1.  Group the city\'s neighborhoods into clusters based on their
    population density and industrial proximity. This clustering should
    happen without using pre-labeled data.

2.  Using the city graph your group has already built, generate a
    synthetic crime dataset by assigning incident rates to each
    neighborhood based on its properties such as population density,
    location type, and proximity to industrial zones. You decide the
    logic for how these factors influence crime likelihood, but you must
    be able to justify that logic. Use this generated data to train a
    classification model that predicts the risk level (High, Medium, or
    Low) for each neighborhood.

3.  The predicted risk level for each location must be fed back into the
    shared city graph, where it acts as an additional cost multiplier.
    High-risk areas increase the effective travel cost for the
    pathfinding and ambulance placement challenges, reflecting the added
    difficulty of operating in those zones.

*Think carefully about what type of learning is involved in the first
step and what type in the second step. Why are they different? How does
integrating this output with the rest of the system demonstrate the
value of machine learning in a decision-support pipeline?*

# 4. System Integration

The five challenges are not independent modules. They must work together
as a single coherent system. During evaluation, your system will be run
through a simulation scenario that lasts 20 steps. In this scenario:

-   The city layout determined by Challenge 1 sets the initial state of
    the grid

-   The road network from Challenge 2 defines the travel graph

-   The risk predictions from Challenge 5 update the grid weights at the
    start of the simulation

-   As the simulation progresses, ambulance placements from Challenge 3
    are re-evaluated as risk weights shift

-   Meanwhile, flooding events occur randomly, forcing the dynamic
    router from Challenge 4 to adapt in real time

Your system must demonstrate that all five components share the same
underlying city graph and that changes in one part of the system are
immediately visible to all other parts.

# 5. Deliverables and Timeline

The project is divided into three phases across three weeks. Each phase
has a specific deliverable and contributes to your final marks.

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis and Design (Deadline: 26^th^ April)

Before writing any code, your group must submit a design document. This
document should reflect genuine group discussion and thinking. It must
include:

-   A clear statement of how you understand each of the five challenges
    in your own words

-   For each challenge, the AI technique or algorithm your group has
    chosen and a written justification for that choice. You must explain
    why this technique is appropriate and briefly compare it to at least
    one alternative you considered

-   A description of how your shared city graph will be structured and
    how different modules will interact with it

-   A rough sketch or wireframe of your planned user interface

-   A work breakdown showing which group member is responsible for which
    parts

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Regarding AI Tools in Phase 1**                                     |
|                                                                       |
| You are encouraged to use AI tools during Phase 1 for brainstorming   |
| and exploring ideas. However, the final document must reflect your    |
| group\'s own understanding. You will be asked to defend every         |
| decision in it during the viva. If your document proposes using an    |
| algorithm but no one in your group can explain how it works, that     |
| will be visible immediately during evaluation.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Phase 2: Implementation (Deadline: 10^th^ May)

Develop the full system according to your design document. The
implementation must include:

-   All five challenge modules, each working correctly on its own

-   A working integration of all modules through the shared city graph

-   A visual interface that displays the city grid in real time and
    supports toggling between views: the road network, ambulance
    coverage, and crime risk heatmap

-   A live event log that records decisions made by the system at each
    simulation step, for example noting when a road is blocked and how
    the router responded

You are free to use AI tools to assist with writing and debugging code
during this phase. However, your team must be able to trace through the
execution of any algorithm in your system from first principles.

## Phase 3: Demonstration and Defense (Dead Week)

Each group will present a live demonstration of their system. During the
demonstration, you will be asked to run the simulation and show all
components working together. Following the demonstration, each group
member will face individual questions about the code and the reasoning
behind design choices. You will also be given a live modification
challenge: a constraint in one of the five challenges will be changed on
the spot, and you will need to show how your system adapts.

# 6. Evaluation Rubric

The total marks for this project are 100. The rubric is shared with you
openly so that you know exactly how your work will be assessed. There
are no hidden criteria.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **\#**      **Component**         **What We Are Looking For**       **Marks**
  ----------- --------------------- --------------------------------- -------------
  **1**       **Design Document**   Clear problem understanding.      15 marks
                                    Justified algorithm choices with  
                                    comparison to alternatives.       
                                    Realistic work breakdown. Shows   
                                    evidence of group discussion, not 
                                    just a generic AI-generated plan. 

  **2**       **Technical           Each of the five challenges must  30 marks
              Implementation**      work correctly in isolation (4    
                                    marks each = 20 marks). The       
                                    shared city graph must function   
                                    correctly and updates must        
                                    propagate across all modules (5   
                                    marks). System-level integration  
                                    during the 20-step simulation     
                                    must hold together (5 marks).     

  **3**       **AI Concept          The project must meaningfully     20 marks
              Coverage**            demonstrate at least four         
                                    distinct AI techniques from the   
                                    course (search, constraint        
                                    satisfaction, optimization,       
                                    machine learning, etc.). Marks    
                                    are awarded for correct           
                                    application, not just presence.   
                                    Using a technique in a way that   
                                    does not fit the problem earns    
                                    partial credit at best.           

  **4**       **Viva and Live       Each member is asked individually 20 marks
              Defense**             to explain at least one algorithm 
                                    in the system from first          
                                    principles (10 marks). The group  
                                    must complete the live            
                                    modification challenge: a         
                                    constraint is changed on the spot 
                                    and the system must adapt and be  
                                    explained (10 marks). Inability   
                                    to explain code produced by the   
                                    group results in significant mark 
                                    reduction.                        

  **5**       **Interface and       The visual interface must show    15 marks
              Presentation**        the city grid with working        
                                    overlay toggles for road network, 
                                    ambulance coverage, and crime     
                                    risk heatmap. The event log must  
                                    function during the simulation.   
                                    Creativity in interface design    
                                    and extra features earn           
                                    additional marks up to the full   
                                    15.                               

  **Total**                                                           **100 marks**
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How Individual Marks Are Determined Within a Group

Group marks are awarded for the technical and integration components.
Individual marks depend on the viva. A group member who cannot explain
their contribution or the algorithms used in the project will receive
reduced marks from the viva component, regardless of how well the system
performs. The viva is your opportunity to demonstrate that you actually
built and understood what your group submitted.

# 7. Guidance on Using AI Tools

You are not prohibited from using AI tools during this project. However,
you should understand that the evaluation is designed with AI-generated
code in mind. Here is what this means in practice.

If your group submits a perfectly polished system that no one can
explain during the viva, you will score poorly. The viva carries
significant weight and is the primary mechanism for verifying genuine
learning. The modification challenge is particularly useful here because
it requires live adaptation, not recitation.

The most productive way to use AI tools in this project is as a thinking
partner during design, as a reference for syntax and debugging during
implementation, and as a reviewer to check your logic once you have
already written it. Groups that use AI to understand algorithms will
benefit. Groups that use AI to avoid understanding algorithms will find
the viva very difficult.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Recommended Use of AI Tools by Phase**                              |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  Phase 1 (Design): Use AI to explore and compare approaches. Ask   |
|     it to explain pros and cons of different algorithms for your      |
|     specific problem. Then write your design document in your own     |
|     words.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| ```{=html}                                                            |
| <!-- -->                                                              |
| ```                                                                   |
| 1.  Phase 2 (Implementation): Use AI to help with tricky syntax,      |
|     debugging, or understanding how a library works. Do not paste the |
|     entire challenge description and ask for a complete solution. You |
|     will not be able to explain or modify code you did not understand |
|     when writing it.                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| ```{=html}                                                            |
| <!-- -->                                                              |
| ```                                                                   |
| 1.  Phase 3 (Defense): Review your own code before the viva. Be ready |
|     to walk through any function and explain what it does, why it was |
|     written that way, and how it connects to the broader system.      |
